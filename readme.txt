CSS Properties: 

Used float to put divs in the navbar. Utilized background-color, color, border, and border-radius to style the a tags that link to different pages. For the drop down I used a div to hold the drop down tags and when a user hovers over the drop down container, the list is displayed by changing the display property to block. To add a shadow to the drop down box I used the box-shadow property. To add hover states I used the CSS pseudo-class :hover to add styling to the drop downs and buttons. To make the drop down appear over the rest of the content I changed the background of the dropdown menu to white.

Features:

1. Transition and Transformation
2. The transition expands the div when hovered on and the transformation
acts like a card being flipped, this feature is disabled for mobile.
3. Transition is in the "Hey Everybody" div, Transformation is at the bottom
of the page where mailing is, but only on the home page. Both features are contained in the root index.html
page
